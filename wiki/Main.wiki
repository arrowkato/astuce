*ASTUce*

ASTUce stand for "!ActionScript Test Unit compact edition".<br>
ASTUce is a regression testing framework inspired by the xUnit architecture.

This framework is intended for developers who wish to implement unit tests in !ActionScript3.

Ideally the framework will be usable in any other ES4 implementation.


= Philosophy =

We believe in
 * unit tests that run as fast as possible
 * mock objects to emulate events etc. (or any async stuff)

because of that asyncronous tests have not been implemented,
ASTUce is syncronous only.

We think
 * GUI for unit tests sucks and we intend to change that
